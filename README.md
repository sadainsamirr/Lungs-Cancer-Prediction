## Introduction

Lung cancer is a major global health problem and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Machine learning techniques have gained attention for their potential to improve early detection, diagnosis, and patient outcome predictions.

This project explores the application of various machine learning algorithms for lung cancer analysis and prediction. We aim to develop accurate models to aid in early detection, diagnosis, and prognosis.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to leverage machine learning algorithms for:

- Predicting the likelihood of lung cancer based on patient data.
- Early detection and diagnosis of lung cancer.
- Improving patient outcomes through personalized treatment.

We utilize the following machine learning algorithms:

- Logistic Regression Classification
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification
- Naive Bayes Classification
- Decision Tree Classification
- Random Forest Classification
- K-Nearest Neighbor Classification

## Methods

### Logistic Regression Classification

Logistic regression predicts the probability of a patient having lung cancer based on factors such as age, gender, smoking status, and medical history.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification

SVM aims to find a hyperplane that separates lung cancer patients from non-cancer patients in a high-dimensional space.

### Naive Bayes Classification

Naive Bayes calculates the probability of lung cancer based on a set of independent variables, assuming that feature presence is unrelated.

### Decision Tree Classification

Decision tree creates a model of decisions and consequences based on given features to predict lung cancer probability.

### Random Forest Classification

Random forest combines multiple decision trees to enhance accuracy and robustness for lung cancer prediction.

### K-Nearest Neighbor Classification

K-Nearest Neighbor predicts lung cancer likelihood based on characteristics of neighboring data points.
